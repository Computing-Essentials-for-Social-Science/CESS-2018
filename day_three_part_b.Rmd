## Get giddy about the possibilities!
          
## count_problems $=G($ data_size$^\alpha), \alpha > 1$?

## Probably not, just different problems
 - Pitfalls of Inference
 - Ethical/legal considerations
 - Practical considerations
 

## Salganik's Characterists of Big Data

(PUP, 2018)

## Characterists BD **can** have
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">  - **Huge N** </span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">  - Not created for science* </span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">  - Always-on </span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">  - Nonreactive </span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">  - Incomplete </span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6">  - Inaccessible </span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7">  - Nonrepresentive </span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8">  - Drifting </span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="9">  - Algorithmically-confounded </span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="10"> - Dirty </span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="11"> - Sensitive </span><br>
  

## Big Data is indeed big, but is correlation is enough?  
<aside class="notes">Does BD mean the end of theory? This is some of more philosophical stuff.</aside>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"> - whole of sample frame is not the population, unless science of X</span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"> - systemic bias instead sampling bias</span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"> - P-hacking, [meet N-hacking: 6:06 mark](https://mediasite.kellogg.northwestern.edu/Mediasite/Play/70c3061a791c46efa349f89670d72bc61d?playFrom=10656&autoStart=true&popout=true)<br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4"> - More about new types of data, or richness of context </span>


## Not created for science
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"> - "digital exhaust"</span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"> - weak link between **construct** and **measures**</span>
  
## Always-on
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">  - Old: HS diploma to job at 28</span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">  - New: Location every 15 minutes.</span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-frogment-index="3">  - But: When is this informative? Are we answering different questions?</span>
  
## Nonreactive
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">  - Old: Generosity in lab studies (reactivity/Hawthorne effect)</span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">  - New: Don't know about observation, or is now normalized</span><br>
<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">  - But: Have you been on Instagram?</span>

## Incomplete: If only I had:
<aside class="notes">Relates to are we answering different types of questions?</span>
  - gender
  - income
  - race/ethnicity
  - IQ
  - party affliation
  - ...

## Incessible
<aside class="notes">Google knows most basic things about all of US pop. Can we see it plz?</aside>
 - Private companies own it
 - Governments collect it but don't share
 
## Nonrepresentative
 - Who actually tweets anyway?
 - But nonrandom sample can still be very useful!
  
## Drifting
<aside class="notes">Pop, behavior: Facebook system - PageRank, predictive search</aside>
  - population
  - behavior
  - system 
  
## Algorithmically confounded
  - unique experiences (N treatment groups)
  - recommenders
  - Matthew effect/increasing returns/preferential attachment
  - action triggers
  
## Bigger question: Is social life now algorithmically confounded?
  Lack of treatment controls is one thing, but <br>
  exposures compound to substantial change.<br>
  <ul>
  <li>those confounds create new reality</li>
  <li>Facebook vote encouragement</li>
  <li>LinkedIn recommendations</li>
  </ul>

## Dirty
  - Wait, Russians can use Twitter too?!
  - Wait, computers can do automated tasks?!
  
## Sensitive
  - More so than you might think: [Meta data](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/)
  - Merging or cross referencing data sets, especially so
  
# Ethical and legal considerations

## Ethical
  - Loss of Privacy (See [Netflix Prize](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shmat/netflix-faq.html))
  - Violation of trust (See Cambridge Analytica)
  - Exploitation
  - Lack of informed consent
  
## Legal Pitfalls
  - Violation of User Agreements ([Sandvig vs Sessions](https://www.aclu.org/cases/sandvig-v-sessions-challenge-cfaa-prohibition-uncovering-racial-discrimination-online))
  - Impersonation
  - Deception
  
## Legal hangups
  - Formal data use agreements can happen without scientific input.
  - Can take a long time
  - Can be expensive
  
## Paging IRB!
  - behind the times, don't understand tech systems
  - assumes you'll follow UA?

# Practical considerations

## You might have to read more widely
  - physicists doing S.S. in _Science_ and _PNAS_, etc.<br>
  <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"><center><img class="plain" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/physicists.png"></center></span>
  
## You have to move quickly
  - Small tweaks to websites can break scripts
  - Data are more widely available, more people study them
  
## But you might have to move slowly too
  - harvesting data can take time
  - stay off server blacklists
  
## Social science is moving toward lab or collaborative model
  - You should work with others
  - Important to share and read other's code
  - Must be flexible

## It's important to start with observation
  Platforms support actions that:<br>
  <ul>
  <li>go unused</li>
  <li>get co-opted</li>
  </ul>
  
## It's important to start with observation
  Platforms can have unique:<br>
  <ul>
  <li>norms</li>
  <li>terms</li>
  <li>meanings for words</li>
  <li>...?</li>
  </ul>
    
## Scraping just ain't what it used to be
  - Most webpages are dynamic and idiosyncratic
  - Server-side ops/parameters are intentionally opaque
  
## You can ask for data from corporations and other orgs
  - think of quid pro quo
  - Use LinkedIn to find lower level people who might care
  - use email finders or domain hack address
  - repeat
  
## You can use Mturk (or its mirrors)!
  - cheaply label training set
  - cheaply validate results
  - but I'm skeptical of survey results
  
# And yet, it's an exciting time to be doing social science!
