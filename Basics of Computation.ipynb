You can absolutely learn programming that way, but in our opinion it is like learning to run regressions before understanding the <em> central limit theorem</em>; you can get interesting results, but eventually someone or something is going to ask you to clarify or fix your process and you won't be able to.\n",

The same relationship exists between human communication and human language; the more you come to see successful communication as the goal, the better you'll become at using language to achieve your goals. Learning to better express yourself requires first learning to see your utterances as just the first step in the process of communication and knowing more about the subsequent steps should condition how you take that first step. Thankfully, just as there many ways to successfully use human language, there are many equally good ways to code up a computational task. But recognizing a good way to code is easier if you understand more about what happens once you actually run your code, so we'll start with the basics of computation.\n",

You know at least something about all of these because you bought your computer by looking at its specs, like the **GHz** (speed) of the processor, the **GB** (size) of memory and the **GB** (size) of storage. More is better for all of these and the digital age we live in has been enabled by the fact that _more_ kept getting cheaper and physically smaller.

    "**Memory and Storage**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A first helpful thing to know is the difference between __memory__ and __storage__. These days they're both measured in _gigabytes_ and actually do roughly the same thing, that is, store information. So why do we make a distinction between the two? Well, remember back in high school when you crammed for a history test, probably aced it, and then within two weeks couldn't easily remember the significance, year--maybe even location--of the _Philadelphia Convention_? Just like a computer, we generally don't hold information at the ready if we aren't going to use it soon. If you're a real scholar, you were able to make sure all those historical facts made it into longterm storage. Lots of people who just crammed ended up deleting the content of their memory, either immediately or over the next couple of years.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For computers, there are energy costs associated with keeping information at the ready in __memory__ and time costs associated with getting it out of __storage__, so computers need to strike the right balance in where information is stored. Furthermore, there always needs to be more memory available than the amount of information brought in from storage because computations themselves make use of memory as they hold information about intermediate states that won't be needed later.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Intermediate states are very common. Say you want the sum of the following numbers; 11, 24, 37, 50. Your computer (and you probably) would sequentially add these up with a running total. The running total after the first two numbers, 35, is held as a local variable in memory and won't ever get sent to storage. Complex calculations can use up a lot of memory with these intermediate states (a.k.a. variables).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "So both storage and memory hold information but are distinguishable by how quickly the processor--we'll get to it next--can get to it. It's easy enough to add storage or move information into storage not directly attached to your computer (e.g. external hard drive), so what matters more for computation is the memory. You need enough of it hold all the information you need for a particular computation and to execute that computation. Without enough memory, the computation process breaks down. You may have encountered this problem if you've used older statistical software packages. Because anything running on your computer (music app, browsers, word processors, connections) are using memory, those stats programs were pretty conservative in how much memory they asked to be set aside for them. It was often something like 100MB. If your dataset was bigger than that allotment, you needed to tell the software to request more before you could even look at the data. It just wouldn't even transfer the data from storage into memory!\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "There is less of a need today to be conservative like that because the cost and availability of memory and better means of dynamically alloting memory. But at the same time, data sets are getting bigger and if you're using one of these massive datasets, you might want to invest in more memory, or better yet, think about ways to structure your project in ways breaks the computations down into chunks that demands less memory.\n",

    "The above discussion of memory and storage gave some hints about what the processor (a.k.a. chip) is doing. It is the component that takes instructions and manipulates the states of a bunch of binary transitors (and I mean a [bunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count)--most of our computers have more than 3 billion of them) to map the input to an output via the given instructions. A processor is actually composed of several different sets of subunits. The two sets worth knowing about for this overview are the set comprising the _control_ unit and  the set comprising the _arithmetic__logic_ unit. The former controls the logical manipulations of the latter.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This division is known as the Von Neumann architecture. It's common for personal computers, but not necessary. The image above shows the whole architecture but Von Neumann's contribution was the splitting of the processor (or _central processing unit_, CPU) into the _control_ and _arithmetic logic_ units. Our brains sometimes operate with a division something like this, but often do not. A lot of human logical manipulations don't need a controller and we should be glad about that. We wouldn't have made it very far as a species if we needed a control unit to tell some other unit to explicitly calculate that an input of a burning sensation from your hand should have an output of removing said hand from the fire. That \"logic\" is hardwired into our nervous system, likely even between the hand and the spinal cord. There are dedicated computer processors that work more like this, but personal computers need flexibility and therefore need a control unit.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The control unit takes the next line of the instructions held in the memory, decodes it, finds the operands (variables) in memory and retrieves them while keeping track of where in the instructions it currently is. __This process is really the heart of computation and programming.__ The mathematics of binary operators are beautiful and the true foundation of computing, but there is little value in understanding them. Similarly, as humans out in the world, we don't really know or care how our brains add 2 and 2. You might be aware of some of the steps involved, but you don't experience the conversion of those visual signals into electrical impulses cascading down a network of neurons.\n",

    "It is our opinion that understanding those logical operations won't help you succeed in your career as a social scientist. Knowing that something has to take each line of the instructions you coded, find and get the relevant variables and ship them off to the arithmetic logic unit with the now-fully decoded instructions _*is*_ helpful. How? Well, to make the job of the control unit as easy as possible, some magic happens between you finishing your code (usually written in English) and the control unit getting instructions. This dark art is the _**translation**_ process.\n",

On the righthand side is what is being assigned to that variable. It can be almost any you could think of, as long as that thing either already exists or you're simultaneously telling Python how to create it. Numbers, and a bunch of other things, are what are known as **native** types in Python and therefore already exist as **objects**.
