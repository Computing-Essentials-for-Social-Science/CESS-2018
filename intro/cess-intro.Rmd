## Today
- Introductions
- Program Requirements
- What is data science? What do we hope to get out of this? 
- Python vs R 
- What do you need to learn and not learn to succeed with data science

## Let's get to know one another 

## Jon Atwell
- Michigan PhD, 2017 - Sociology
- Studies the emergence of culture and norms
- Expertise: Python, text methods, agent-based modeling

## Chris Skovron 
- Michigan PhD, 2017 - Political Science
- Studies public opinion and what people believe about it
- Expertise: R, statistical modeling, causal inference

## CESS students were chosen because
- You already show creativity and promise in your research projects and ideas
- Many of these projects could benefit from data science approaches 
- You don't already know all the things we are going to teach

## We expect from you 
- Sustained commitment to integrating data science methods in your research
- Be a resource for your colleagues, both students and faculty 
- Be flexible, open to struggling and learning new things about yourself and your research 

## Program requirements 
- Three sessions this week
- At least four additional sessions. Intro R and Python count as two sessions. 
- Optional but suggested to attend afternoon practice sessions for workshops. 
- Participate in future data science programming put on by Data Science Initiative 

## Program support
- Jon and I will be mentors
- We aren't here to debug but will help you strategize and find resources
- Research Computing Services is another source of support
